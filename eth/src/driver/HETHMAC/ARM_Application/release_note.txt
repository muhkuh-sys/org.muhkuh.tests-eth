Ethernet Standard MAC HAL

Version  Name  Date       Revision History
6.2.0.2  AO    22.11.2018 Added support of netX90, dropped support of netX90MPW
                          Fixed: PC Lint warnings
6.2.0.1  BI    14.03.2018 Fixed: Default MAC addresses should not match all zeros
6.2.0.0  BI    02.03.2018 Added: supported counters OUT_FRAMES_OKAY, IN_FRAMES_OKAY for netX51/90/4000
6.1.0.0  AO    12.05.2017 Added target NXHX90_JTAG
                          Added targets NXHX4000JTAG+, NXHX4000_SWITCH
                          Change: EthMac_SetLinkMode() sets MAC into 10HDX in case of link down
                          Added: 2nd chassis address support
                          Changed: Multicast filter set/clear mechanism changed to Add/Delete group address
6.0.0.0  AO    07.02.2017 Merged projects "Ethernet Standard MAC" and "Ethernet Standard MAC for external PHY" to "Ethernet MAC", so "Ethernet Standard MAC for external PHY" is discontinued
                          Change: speed and duplex mode for internal PHYs must be set by Ethernet MAC HAL User and is not determinded by MAC automatically
                                  Ethernet MAC HAL is not transparent regarding internal or external PHY
                                  HAL user must set speed and duplex at link change event or cyclically
5.1.0.0  AO    01.12.2016 Change: SFD detection based on "0x5d" instead on "0xd" only (since netX10, not netX50/100/500)
                          Change: no differentiation between untagged and VLAN-tagged frames, frame length incl. FCS always checked for =< 1522 bytes
                          Bugfix: netX50/51/52 only: no detection of UTX underflow in FDX
                          Change: EARLY_RCV interrupt triggered after reception of Ethernet Destination Address instead of Ethernet Source Address
                          Added: since netX51/52/4000/...: high-precise timestamping in ingress and egress
                          Change: since netX51/52/4000/...: SYSTIME resolution (systime_clock_count_value) should be 1 ns because high-precise timestamping requires 1 ns resolution
                                                            else receive timestamp errors of up to 250 ns may occur
                          Dropped: support of counters FRAMES_RECEIVED_OKAY and FRAMES_TRANSMITTED_OKAY
                          Added: support of counters IN_OCTETS and OUT_OCTETS
                          Some minor corrections within hal_eth_std_mac.c to solve warnings found by PC Lint
5.0.0.0  AO    08.03.2016 Merging all netX derivates to netX Studio project (Hitex Hitop IDE support dropped)

Hardware plattform:
NXHX500-RE (Ethernet MAC on XC channel 0/1)

Version  Name  Date       Revision History
1.000    AO    01.03.2006 Created
2.000    MT    08.12.2006 Fixed Multicast address enabling/checking
                          Updated to XC Standard Ethernet MAC Microcode 1.005
                          Removed IRQ locking. This needs to be done by user if used in a multithreading
                          system by using mutexes/spinlocks etc. The example enters those functions with
                          locked irq
                          Changed GetCounters to NOT return a pointer to xpec memory to user. Instead it fetches
                          all counters and places them in a used provided structure
2.001    AJ    19.01.2007 Updated to XC Standard Ethernet MAC Microcode 1.006
2.002    HPf   12.02.2007 Updated to XC Standard Ethernet MAC Microcode 1.007

                          Added support for external PHYs on ports 2 and 3
                          Extracion of OS and MMU dependent defines and functions in separate header files
